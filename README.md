# INM702: Programming and Mathematics for Artificial Intelligence

Note: This repository and its contents support the coursework of the INM702 module at City, University of London.

We provide the code for Task 1 and Task 2, as Jupyter Notebooks. In Task 1 we create a neural network from scratch, and train it on the MNIST dataset. In Task 2, we use PyTorch on our own chosen dataset to train a neural network.

## Task 1

Task 1 involves the creation of a neural network using only mathematical packages such as NumPy.

## Task 2

Task 2 involves the use of PyTorch.
